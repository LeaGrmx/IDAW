<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
    
    <p class = "alinea">Since middle-school, I have known I want to work in the medical field, to bring my contribution to this sector which is constantly evolving. As a fourth-year engineering student at Institut-Mines- Télécom in Douai, France, I would particularly appreciate to get a closer look at the innovations you offered to your customers and to see their daily impact in their lives by carrying out an internship in ***, from April to August 2022. </p>
    <p class = "alinea"> What’s more, my studies, in preparatory class or in engineering school, allow me to learn and to develop my skills to solve problems quickly in order to be as efficient as possible. Thanks to my project for the third-year in engineering school, which aims to facilitate the patient’s care path when leaving the hospital by creating a web app, I have had the opportunity to build skills in IT, and to learn how to work together. Last year, thanks to my internship at the University Hospital Center in Lille, in the Digital Resources and Information System Department, I gained experience by working in team, and improved my communication skills. </p>
    <p class = "alinea"> Resourceful, self-motivated, proactive in bringing solutions to problems and having always been attracted to the medical field, I feel I’m an ideal candidate for an internship in your company. On the one hand, I’m certain I have the ability to learn quickly and the skills to bring a fresh perspective to your projects. On the other hand, it would really be a rewarding experience to have the opportunity to work for a leading company like yours in the medical technology field. </p>
    <p> I would be pleased to discuss with you in more details at an interview so if you have any questions or require further information, please feel free to contact me. </p>
    <p> Thanks for your time and consideration.</p>
    
    <p> Yours faithfully,</p>
    <p> Léa GRUMIAUX</p>
